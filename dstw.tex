\begin{abstract}
% insert abstract here
We study experimentally sawtooth wave-like pressure changes associated with gas-liquid flow in a pipe-chamber system.
Due to the coupling of an elastic capacitance of a gas chamber and non-linear pressure drop in the pipe, the characteristic pressure waveforms are observed.
For specific conditions, pressure cycles are disturbed spontaneously even at a constant flow rate and chamber volume.
We report a modulation of the pressure waveform through experimental parameters.  
Through image analyses, we point out the effect of surface disturbance of downward flow.

\section{Experimental method}\label{met}
\subsection{Experimental setup}\label{setup}
The experimental system comprised a chamber and pipe, where a constant gas flux was maintained in the chamber, and the gas–liquid flow in the pipe. 
The chamber, pipe, and connecting-joint were constructed using acrylic glass to ensure rigidity and enable direct observations. 
The chamber was partially filled with water to adjust the compressible gas volume ($V_\mathrm{c}$) (Fig. 2, blue part at the bottom of the chamber). 
$V_\mathrm{c}$ is maintained at a constant value during each experimental run.
Gas flux into the chamber ($Q_\mathrm{in}$) was regulated by a micro needle valve (IBS FMNV2) that ensured a constant gas flux of between m3/s. 
We used sugar syrup diluted in distilled water as the liquid phase. The liquid behaved as a Newtonian fluid, and we measured its viscosity using a BOHLIN CVO Rheometer, and adjusted it to 1 Pa･s at the experimental temperature of 25 °C. Injected gas flowed through the pipe and forced the liquid residing in the pipe upward, resulting in gas–liquid flow within the pipe.
A pressure sensor (KISTLER 701A with a 5011A charge amplifier) was installed to measure pressure changes in the chamber, and a microphone (Bruel \& Kjaer 4193+2669L with a Nexus 2690 signal conditioner) was mounted to the top of the pipe. Data were sampled at 10 kHz using a PC-based data acquisition system (DEWETRON DEWE-211).
A high-speed black-and-white camera (Photoron FASTCAM Mini) was synchronized with the data acquisition PC and was focused on the lowermost 200 mm of the pipe, where gas–liquid flow occurred. The field of view was illuminated by a flat backlight source. We used a pale-color syrup so as to improve the visibility of the liquid phase against the gas phase and the pipe. Dark areas were thus shaded according to the thickness of the liquid across the pipe. We used the resulting distribution of light intensity to observe flow patterns.
The controlled experimental parameters were $V_\mathrm{c}$, $Q_\mathrm{in}$, and the amount of syrup in the pipe; as defined by the initial syrup height $H_\mathrm{s}$. These parameters were fixed during each experimental run. 
We conducted 143 runs in total, during which the parameters varied from m3/s for $Q_\mathrm{in}$, 20 to 157 cm3 for $V_\mathrm{c}$, and 60 to 150 mm for $H_\mathrm{s}$. 
Data were recorded from the beginning of each run for at least 20 pressure cycles.

% If in two-column mode, this environment will change to single-column
% format so that long equations can be displayed. Use
% sparingly.
%\begin{widetext}
% put long equation here

% figures should be put into the text as floats.
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)
% and the \includegraphics macro defined in those packages.
% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.

% Surround figure environment with turnpage environment for landscape

% tables should appear as floats within the text
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
% \begin{tabular}{} command.
% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a
% reasonable default table settings.
% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
% Add \usepackage{longtable} and the longtable (or longtable*}
% environment for nicely formatted long tables. Or use the the [H]
% placement option to break a long table (with less control than 
% in longtable).
% \begin{table}%[H] add [H] placement to break table across pages
